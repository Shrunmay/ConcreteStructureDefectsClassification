This repository contains python notebook for two stage classification and detection of defects in concrete structures.
The dataset is sourced from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniruddhsharma/structural-defects-network-concrete-crack-images
Stage 1 model classifies the input image into 1 of 3 classes: Pavement, Deck and Wall.
Stage 2 model is used to detect cracks in that image.
.h5 files for each model are here in the given drive links:
